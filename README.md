# ngMario

Example for the experimental `httpResource` in Angular 19.2.

Please note:

- The game "engine" is treated as a black box.
- The level is constructed via the tiles map in `public/tiles.png` (see below)
- The level structure is defined via json files in `public/levels`.

```bash
npm i
ng serve -o
```
